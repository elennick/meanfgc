MeanFGC is the working title for a site that aggregates fighting game videos. The key focus is to make them easily searchable on key fields such as:

* Game (ie: Ultra Street Fighter 4, UMVC3, Soul Calibur 5, etc)
* Event (ie: Evolution 2014, CEO 2012, WNF, etc)
* Type (ie: Match, Tutorial, Combo Demonstration, etc)
* Characters (ie: Ryu vs Ken, Talim vs Nightmare, Dive vs Kick, etc)
* Players (ie: Daigo vs Infiltration, Dab vs Sonic Fox, etc)
* more...

This project is very early in development.
